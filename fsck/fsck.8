.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Fsck
audits, and interactively repairs inconsistent conditions for \s-2UNIX\s+2 file systems.
If the file system is consistent then the number of files, number of blocks
used, and number of blocks free are reported.
If the file system is inconsistent the operator is prompted for concurrence
before each correction is attempted.
It should be noted that most corrective actions will result in some loss
of data.
The amount and severity of data lost may be determined from the diagnostic
output.
The default action for each consistency correction
is to wait for the operator to respond "yes" or "no".
If the operator does not have write permission
.it fsck
will default to a
.bd \*-r
action.
.s1
.it Fsck
has more consistency checks than
\fIcheck, dcheck, fcheck, \fPand\fI icheck\fP
combined.
.s1
.lp +0 0
The following flags are interpreted by
.it fsck.
.s1
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-y\fR	Assume a yes response to all questions asked by
.it fsck.
.s1
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-n\fR	Assume a no response to all questions asked by
.it fsck.
.s1
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-q\fR	Wait for an operator response to each question (default).
.s1
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-r\fR	Open the file system read only.
.s1
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-u\fR	Open the file system for updating (default).
.s1
.lp +6 5
\fB\*-s\fR\fIX\fP	Ignore the actual free list and reconstruct a new
one by rewriting the super-block of the file system.
The file system should be unmounted while this is done; if this
is not possible, care should be taken that the system is quiescent
and that it is rebooted immediately afterwards.
This precaution is necessary so that the old, bad, in-core copy
of the superblock will not continue to be used, or written on the file system.
.s1
The
\fB\*-s\fR\fIX\fP
option allows for creating an optimal free-list organization.
The following forms of
.it X
are supported for the following devices:
.lp +12 5
3	(RP03)
.lp +12 5
4	(RP04, RP05, RP06)
.lp +12 5
\fIBlocks/cylinder:Blocks-to-skip\fP	(for any other device)
.lp +6 0
If
.it X
is not given, a default value of
.it 1:1
is used.
.s1
.lp +0 0
If no filesystems are given to
.it fsck
then a default list of file systems are read from
the file
.it /etc/checklist.
.s1
Inconsistencies checked are as follows:
.s1
.lp +6 5
1.	Blocks claimed by more than one inode or the free list.
.br
.lp +6 5
2.	Blocks claimed by an inode or the free list outside the range of the file system.
.br
.lp +6 5
3.	Incorrect link counts.
.br
.lp +6 5
.br
.lp +6 5
.ne 5
4.	Size checks:
.lp +12 0
.br
Directories greater than 65536.
.br
Incorrect number of blocks.
.br
Directory size not 16 byte aligned.
.br
Directory entries beyond directory size.
.br
.lp +6 5
5.	Bad inode format.
.br
.lp +6 5
6.	Blocks not accounted for anywhere.
.br
.lp +6 5
.ne 3
7.	Directory checks:
.br
.lp +12 0
File pointing to unallocated inode.
.br
Inode number out of range.
.br
.lp +6 5
.ne 3
8.	Super Block checks:
.br
.lp +12 0
More than 65536 inodes.
.br
More blocks for inodes than there are in the file system.
.br
.lp +6 5
9.	Bad free block list format.
.br
.lp +6 5
10.	Total free block count incorrect.
.sh FILES
.lp 21 16
/etc/checklist	contains default list of file systems to check.
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics produced by
.it fsck
are intended to be self-explanatory.
.sh SEE ALSO
.it checklist
(V),
.it fs
(V),
.it crash
(VIII)
.sh BUGS
Inode numbers for \fB.\fP and \fB..\fP in each directory should be check for validity.
.s1
\fB\*-g\fP, and \fB\*-b\fP options from
.it check
should be available in
.it fsck.
.s1
If the actual link count for an inode is zero, but the inode thinks
it's one, the inode should not be cleared, but rather linked to a scratch
directory.
