.th GETTY VIII 17/6/77
.sh NAME
getty \*- set mode of terminal
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd /etc/getty
[char]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.bd "Getty"
is invoked by
.it init(VIII).
It first prints the 'Login:' message on the terminal
and reads the user's name.
It then forks
.it login(I)
with the user's name as argument.
Getty attempts to adapt the system to the
characteristics of the terminal.
.s3
.it "Getty"
is called by
.it init
when
.it init
succeeds in opening the terminal,
either when the system comes up, or when the terminal
is switched on.
.it Getty
is called with a one letter argument, this letter
being taken from the entry for that
port in the
.it /etc/ttys
file.
It is used to guess what kind of terminal
is attached to the port.
The values are :-
.s1
.lp +12 7
-	console DECwriter (300 baud)
.lp +12 7
0	(i)  general purpose (300 baud)
.lp +12
	(ii) general purpose (110 baud)
.lp +12 7
1	DECwriters (300 baud)
.lp +12 7
2	teletypes (110 baud, lcase)
.lp +12 7
3	slow VDUs (300 baud)
.lp +12 7
4	fast VDUs (4800 baud)
.lp +12 7
5 	Data100s (1200 baud)
.i0
.s3
Each entry in this table (except '0'(ii)) has a successor.
The '-' entry has itself as successor,
and the successor of '0'(i) is '0'(ii).
All other entries have '0'(i) as their successor.
The '0' entries set <newline> and <return>
delays adequate for most printing terminals.
.s3
.it "Getty"
puts the terminal into
.it userdelimit
and
.it breaks
mode (see tty(IV)), with all characters less than <space>
(except ^r)
specified as user delimit characters.
The first user delimit character to be
typed ends the name.
.s3
If the user's name ends in <newline> it is accepted;
if it ends in <return> it is also accepted,
but the terminal is put into
.it crmod
mode.
If the name ends in anything else it is not accepted,
and except for two special cases
.it getty
then prints the 'Login:' message again.
.s3
If the name ends in ^c (since
.it breaks
mode is set, <break> is taken as ^c) getty moves to the next entry
in the table,
until it reaches '0'(ii),
whereupon it goes back to the
entry that it started with.
By typing <break> the user can adjust the system to
the speed of the terminal.
.s3
If the name ends in ^z
.it getty
exits, and
.it init
will then fork a new
.it getty
for the port.  This is useful when
.it getty
has become confused.
.s3
When the user's name has been accepted by
.it getty,
it examines the characters in the name,
and if it contains
upper case letters, but no lower case letters
.it getty
will put the terminal into
.bd lcase
mode.
