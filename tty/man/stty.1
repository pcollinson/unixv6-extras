.th STTY I 8/8/77
.sh NAME
stty \*- set and/or report terminal status
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd stty
[ tty x ] [ option ... ]
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Stty
sets and reports the status of terminals.
If the "tty\ x" arguments are given, the command applies to
/dev/ttyx; otherwise it applies to the user's own terminal.
The options which may be used are described below.
If no option is specified, stty merely reports the current status
of the terminal and no change is made.   If any options are given,
stty checks their validity.   An invalid option causes the command
to be rejected.   Once the desired changes have been made, stty
reports the new status of the terminal.
The command thisisa(I) contains "canned" calls of stty for the
local selection of terminals.

8-bit	    set 8-bit mode (disallowed on user's terminal)
breaks	    treat the break key as equivalent to ^c
data100	    invert lower and upper case on input
echo	    print every character typed
ek	    reset the default erase and kill characters
erase c	    set the erase character to c
even	    allow even-parity input
hold	    (in 8-bit mode) suspend/resume output on ^s/^q
hupcl	    hang up modem connection on last close
indicate    print control-characters legibly (e.g. ^c)
kill c	    set the kill character to c
lower	    equivalent to "!upper"
nl	    allow only <newline> to end input lines
odd	    allow odd-parity input
quiet	    do not report the new status of the terminal
upper	    map lower case for 64-character terminals
vdu	    back-space over erased characters
.sp
!8-bit	    reset 8-bit mode
!breaks	    ignore communication-line breaks
!data100    return to sanity
!delimit    switch off user-delimiting
!echo	    do not print any input
!even	    disallow even-parity input
!hold	    (in 8-bit mode) ignore ^s/^q
!hupcl	    do not hang up modem connection on last close
!indicate   do not print control-characters legibly
!lower	    equivalent to "upper"
!nl	    treat <return> as <newline>
!odd	    disallow odd-parity input
!quiet	    report the new terminal status (default)
!raw	    switch off raw mode

In the following d represents a decimal integer in the
range 0 <= d <= 127 .
.sp
.na
.nf
nldelay d	set the <newline> delay to be d/50 secs
!nldelay	equivalent to "nldelay 0"
.sp
crdelay d	set the <return> delay to be d/50 secs
!crdelay	equivalent to "crdelay 0"
.sp
tabs d		the terminal has hardware tabs, set the
		horizontal-tab delay to be d/50 secs
!tabs d		the terminal does not have hardware tabs, set
		the horizontal tabs stops every d spaces
!tabs 0		set the default horizontal tab stops
!tabs		equivalent to "!tabs 0"
.sp
skips d		the terminal has hardware forms control, set
		the FF/VT delay to be d/50 secs
!skips d	the terminal does not have forms control, set
		the FF/VT skip length to be d linefeeds
!skips 0	ignore FF/VT
!skips		equivalent to "!skips 0"
.sp
line d		set the line width to be d (up to 255 here)
line 0		the line is effectively infinite
!line		equivalent to "line 0"
.sp
page d		set the page length to be d
page 0		the page is effectively infinite
!page		equivalent to "page 0"

.sp 2
In the following s represents one of the 16
speeds (in bits per second, or "baud") :-
.na
.nf
.sp
0     50     75     110     134     150     200     ext-a
300   600    1200   1800    2400    4800    9600    ext-b
.sp
input s		set the input speed to be s
output s	set the output speed to be s
speed s		set the input and output speeds to be s
.sp
.ad
.fi
Specifying a speed of 0 causes the line to be hung-up at once;
impossible speed changes are ignored.
