.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Terms
provides a general system call for reporting and changing
the status of a device.
.s3
At the moment it is only implemented for terminals.
A working knowledge of the tty driver
(described in
.it tty(IV))
is needed to understand the
.it terms
call.
.s3
First, terms waits until the terminal is
quiescent.

.bd speeds
(ispeed, ospeed)
.br
The speeds are selected by the following values, which correspond
to the speeds supported by the DH-11.  For DC-11, DL-11 and KL-11
interfaces impossible speed changes are ignored.

.i0
The code conversion and line control required for
IBM 2741 terminals (134.5 baud)
must be implemented by the user's
program.
Half duplex is not supported.
.s3
.bd "erase, kill"
.br
The erase and kill characters for the terminal may
be set by the user.
The defaults are <delete> and ^u.
.s3
.it mode
.br
This is a collection of one bit flags which determine
the system's treatment of the terminal.

.i0
.s3
In
.it userdelimit
mode, the 'delimit input' characters are
determined by using the
.it breaktable
array as a bit map (8 words = 128 bits).
If bit n of the
.it breaktable
array is set then character n is
a 'delimit input' character.
The least significant bit of word 0 is bit 0,
the most significant of word 7 is bit 127.
.s3
Otherwise, the
.it breaktable
is ignored by the system.
.s3
For a further details of the modes that are
not self-explanatory, see
.it tty(IV).
.s3
.bd delays
.br
The four delay fields each specify a
delay of up to 127 1/50ths of a second after
transmitting the relevant character.
The 'vtdelay' applies to both <formfeed> (FF)
and <vertical tab> (VT).
If tabs are to be replaced by spaces, the 'tabdelay' is treated
as the distance between tab stops.   A distance of zero is taken as the
system default tab size (currently 8).
Similarly, if VT and FF
are to be replaced, the 'vtdelay' gives the number of linefeeds
to output.   A value of zero causes VT and FF to be suppressed.
.s3
.bd linewidth
and
.bd pagelength
.br
See "Line width" and "Paging" in
.it tty(IV).
.s3
.bd "gtty"
and
.bd "stty"
calls
.br
For gtty/stty calls of
.it terms
only the first 5 bytes
of data in *arg are passed, that is up to and including
the first byte of the
.it mode
word.  This is almost compatible with the Bell
.it gtty
and
.it stty
system calls
except that the delays (which occupied the 6th byte
in the old driver) can no longer be reported or reset.

tty(IV), stty(I)
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
The error bit
(c-bit) is set if the file descriptor does not refer to a terminal.
From C, a negative value indicates an error.
