.sh DESCRIPTION
.it "Gtty"
stores in the five bytes addressed by
.it arg
the status
of the terminal whose file descriptor is given in r0
(filedes from C).
.s3
.it "Gtty"
is equivalent to a
.it terms
call with
.it "action=0."
This is fully described in
.it terms(II).
.s3
There is a major difference between the
.it gtty
system call in the new driver and the original Bell
.it gtty
call.  The new call is passed only 5 bytes of
data by the system, whereas the old call
was passed six.  The extra byte contained
the delay settings.  To
obtain the delay settings with the new driver
requires a
.it terms
system call.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
Error bit
(c-bit) is set if the file descriptor does not refer
to a typewriter.
From C, a \*-1 value is returned for an
error, 0, for a successful call.
