.sh DESCRIPTION
.it "Stty"
sets the mode bits and character speeds of the terminal whose
file descriptor
is passed in r0
(filedes from C).
.s3
.it "Stty"
is equivalent to a
.it terms
call with
.it "action=1."
This is fully described in
.bd terms(II)
.s3
There is a major difference between the
.it stty
system call in the the new driver and the
original Bell
.it stty
call. In the new driver only 5 bytes of data
are passed, as opposed to 6 bytes in the
old driver.  The sixth byte used to set the
delays for the terminal; to set the delays
now requires a
.it terms
system call.

.sh DIAGNOSTICS
The error bit
(c-bit) is set if the file descriptor does not refer to a terminal.
From C, a negative value indicates an error.
